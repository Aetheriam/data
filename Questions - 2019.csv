Toll roads,7/8,C,X,,X,X,X,Bob decided to drive from Hamper to Mug. In the map below; circles with letters are cities and lines are two-way roads. Roads also have roundabouts where they intersect. The number beside a road is the toll that cars must pay every time they enter the road. Cars can change their route at roundabouts but they need to pay the full toll for the road they enter. For example; to drive from city B to city C you can take road 18 and road 6 thus the toll fee is 24.,What is the minimum toll fee Bob should pay to drive from Hamper to Mug?,The cheapest road is shown adjacent. To prove that this path is optimal we may compare the options in the following way: The presented path has the toll 41; let’s try to find a cheaper path. At first; it is obvious that the path contains a road A–Hamper with toll 13; so one should find a path from A to Mug that is cheaper than 41 - 13 = 28. Secondly; it is obvious that we should come to Mug not by the road B–Mug; because it is already 23; and it is impossible to find a path from B To A that is cheaper than 28 - 23 = 5. So; we come to Mug by the road D–Mug with the toll 6; and thus we should find a path from A to D that is cheaper than 28 - 6 =22. The path from A to D should not have more than three roads; because the cheapest road has the toll 6; and thus 4 roads will give a toll at least 6 * 4 = 24. The first road we may look at to go out of A is A–B. It leads to much more expensive solutions; because we will use very expensive roads with a toll of either 23 or 18. The same arguments apply for the road A–F; because this road is very expensive. If we use the road A–G; then we will use at least 7 + 9 + 7 = 23 which is greater than 22. And finally; if we go by the road A–C; we can achieve the optimal toll.,Description_Image_30,,Answer_Image_30,41,36,41,42,50,
