Toll roads,7/8,C,X,,X,X,X,Bob decided to drive from Hamper to Mug. In the map below; circles with letters are cities and lines are two-way roads. Roads also have roundabouts where they intersect. The number beside a road is the toll that cars must pay every time they enter the road. Cars can change their route at roundabouts but they need to pay the full toll for the road they enter. For example; to drive from city B to city C you can take road 18 and road 6 thus the toll fee is 24.,What is the minimum toll fee Bob should pay to drive from Hamper to Mug?,The cheapest road is shown adjacent. To prove that this path is optimal we may compare the options in the following way: The presented path has the toll 41; let’s try to find a cheaper path. At first; it is obvious that the path contains a road A–Hamper with toll 13; so one should find a path from A to Mug that is cheaper than 41 - 13 = 28. Secondly; it is obvious that we should come to Mug not by the road B–Mug; because it is already 23; and it is impossible to find a path from B To A that is cheaper than 28 - 23 = 5. So; we come to Mug by the road D–Mug with the toll 6; and thus we should find a path from A to D that is cheaper than 28 - 6 =22. The path from A to D should not have more than three roads; because the cheapest road has the toll 6; and thus 4 roads will give a toll at least 6 * 4 = 24. The first road we may look at to go out of A is A–B. It leads to much more expensive solutions; because we will use very expensive roads with a toll of either 23 or 18. The same arguments apply for the road A–F; because this road is very expensive. If we use the road A–G; then we will use at least 7 + 9 + 7 = 23 which is greater than 22. And finally; if we go by the road A–C; we can achieve the optimal toll.,Description_Image_30,,Answer_Image_30,41,36,41,42,50,

Treasure maps,11/12,B,X,,X,,X,Pirate Beaver has a very large treasure map which is cut into smaller pieces. Each map piece shows a region of 8 units wide and 8 units long (Fig. 1). However; Pirate beaver has a very small boat and cannot take all the map pieces with him. Smart as she is; Pirate beaver finds a way to document each region (map piece) into a small chart in her note book. Here is how:<br>1. If all units in the region are in the same colour; she marks a “square” on her notebook with the same colour.<br>2. Or else; she marks a “circle” (shown as Chart 1) and then divides the region into 4 subregions (shown as Fig. 2) according to its central point.<br>3.

Cost reduction,7/8,C,X,,X,X,X,Beaverland has eight railway stations and five railway lines. The lines are shown in the diagram below; each with a different colour. Note that it is possible to travel from any station to any other station using at most one train transfer. For example; to get from B to H one could follow the purple line from B to F; transfer to the orange line and go to H.<br>Because the railway company wants to reduce costs; they plan to shut down one or more rail lines. They must do this in such a way that all stations stay connected to the railway network and that travelling from any station to any other station can still be done using; at most; one train transfer.,How many railway lines can; at most; be shut down by the railway company?,The correct answer is; at most; 2 lines can be removed (3 lines remain). <br>If you remove the red line (GEDH) and the light blue line (DFC) all conditions are still satisfied. Indeed the lines that remain (BAFC; GEAD and EFH) clearly serve all eight stations and have the additional property that each pair of them has (at least) one station in common. Therefore; you can go from any station to any other with at most one transfer.<br>Would it be possible to remove 3 lines instead of 2? In other words; could all the conditions still be satisfied with using only two lines?<br>The answer is no. Note that the purple line (BAFC) is the only line that serves station B; so it must remain. The other line then must serve the four remaining stations and that leaves red (GEDH) as the only possibility. But these two lines do not have a station in common; and therefore it is; for instance; not possible to travel by train from B to H let alone with; at most; a single transfer. So two lines are not sufficient.,Description_Image_71,,,2,0,1,2,3,
Cost reduction,9/10,B,X,,X,X,X,Beaverland has eight railway stations and five railway lines. The lines are shown in the diagram below; each with a different colour. Note that it is possible to travel from any station to any other station using at most one train transfer. For example; to get from B to H one could follow the purple line from B to F; transfer to the orange line and go to H.<br>Because the railway company wants to reduce costs; they plan to shut down one or more rail lines. They must do this in such a way that all stations stay connected to the railway network and that travelling from any station to any other station can still be done using; at most; one train transfer.,How many railway lines can; at most; be shut down by the railway company?,The correct answer is; at most; 2 lines can be removed (3 lines remain). <br>If you remove the red line (GEDH) and the light blue line (DFC) all conditions are still satisfied. Indeed the lines that remain (BAFC; GEAD and EFH) clearly serve all eight stations and have the additional property that each pair of them has (at least) one station in common. Therefore; you can go from any station to any other with at most one transfer.<br>Would it be possible to remove 3 lines instead of 2? In other words; could all the conditions still be satisfied with using only two lines?<br>The answer is no. Note that the purple line (BAFC) is the only line that serves station B; so it must remain. The other line then must serve the four remaining stations and that leaves red (GEDH) as the only possibility. But these two lines do not have a station in common; and therefore it is; for instance; not possible to travel by train from B to H let alone with; at most; a single transfer. So two lines are not sufficient.,Description_Image_71,,,2,0,1,2,3,
